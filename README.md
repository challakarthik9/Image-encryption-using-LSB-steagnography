# Image-encryption-using-LSB-steagnography
Steganography is the technique of encrypting data in a data carrier (an image, in this case) in such a manner that it is impossible for an outsider to identify that a message has been encrypted into the image. The data carrier may also be an audio file or a text file, however, an image file has been considered for the following. This technique is different from other data hiding methods like watermarking, in the way that it is far subtler. The watermarkâ€™s presence is often broadcasted entirely over the image, which prevents any communication/message to be secretive or discreet. Steganographic techniques are used to hide a large amount of data or files secretly into some innocuous looking digital medium such as images.  In this paper, I am providing an up-to-date review and analysis of this image encryption using steganography technique.
